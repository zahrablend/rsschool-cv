### Summary

Some kind of self-presentation. In case of lack of experience  Junior Developer sells his/her potential, his/her passion and ability to learn fast. You shouldn't think that everybody is going to teach you when you come to the workplace . Rather being a Junior means always
learning new things from everywhere etc.).

6. Skills (e.g. programming languages, frameworks, methodologies, version control, tools etc.)

### Experience
8. Experience (for a Junior Dev it means all kinds of experience: coding tests, projects from courses,
freelance projects - wherever they had the opportunity to demonstrate skills they have.
Also it would be awesome if you add links to source code)

### Education
10. Education (including courses, seminars, lectures, online learning)

### Languages
12. English (elaborate on what kind of practice you had, if any, how long it lasted and so on)
